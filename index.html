            <h2 id="introduction">A Brief History of BABYMETAL</h2>
                <div class="history">
                    <p>Babymetal is a Japanese "kawaii metal" band ("kawaii" meaning "cute"), the concept of the group is a fusion of the metal and Japanese idol genres.
                    The band was formed in 2010 and was originally a sub-unit of the Japanese idol group Sakura Gakuin, however Babymetal became an independent act in 2013.
                    <hr>
                    Babymetal's first live appearance was on November 28 2010. The producer and longtime metal fan Key “Kobametal” Kobayashi stated in an interview, with magazine 
                    <em>Metal Hammer</em> in 2014, that his impetus for the fusion of the ever-popular idol genre with the less-accessible timbre of metal music. 
                    <i>“Metal is only getting older and older and the scene isn’t getting bigger anymore. I started thinking that I wanted to come up with something new, 
                    something that no one has ever done before, and that’s where Babymetal came from. The idea really just fell from the heavens,”</i> 
                    <hr>
                    Babymetal has now gained traction around the world, particularly in Europe and have three major albums:
                    <ol type="I">
                        <li>Self-titled album: BABYMETAL - released 2014</li>
                        <li>METAL RESISTANCE - released 2016</li>
                        <li>METAL GALAXY - released 2019</li>
                    </ol>
                    Instead of the sign of the horns, the band uses the hand gesture of the fox (or more accurately the kitsune) to symbolize the band's divine inspiration. 
                    When asked about this divinity (the 'Fox God') they replied, <i>"We've actually never met the Fox God, but because of his blessing, we were able to become Babymetal."</i>
                    <hr>
                    There were originally 3 members in Babymetal; SU-METAL, MOA-METAL & YUI-METAL, however in 2018 YUI-METAL had to leave the group due to health concerns. Since her departure, 
                    the band has performed with one or more backup dancers at live performances. 
                    From mid-2012, a live band called Full Metal Band (also known as the "Gods of Metal" or "Kami Band") progressively took over accompaniment duties and now perform all 
                    music live at every concert.
