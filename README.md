## BABYMETAL | 10 YEARS!
As this year marks the 10 year anniversary of the launch of one my favourite bands, and as they are so unique, I took this opportunity to create a website dedicated to them, to celebrate their 10 years with a brief history, band-member information, images and videos spanning their career to this point and a place where people could see their upcoming shows and sign-up for more information. 

## UX

Exteral user's goal: the site users are fans and potenital fans of the band, who may wish to learn a little about the band's history and members. See photos of the band from 2011-2019, watch some of their best music videos as well as seeing upcoming shows - dates and locations. 

Site owner's goals: The band are interested in selling more of their music/merchandise, connecting to more fans/potential fans and advertising their upcoming shows. Furthermore, as their audience is becoming more global, they wish to reach a wider international fan-base.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

## Wireframes page designs:

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Existing Features

Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Features Left to Implement

A translation of the lyrics in the songs from the original Japanese, to the language of the user - first starting with English as the most widely spoken language of the international fan-base.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

My project is nice and spaced out on desktop's and large screen resolutions, as the size decreases it adapts and text/images that can sit next to each other slot neatly ontop of each other and ensure that they can be read and seen at small screen sizes and on mobiles.

I did struggle to make my project mobile responsive at first, I received some advice from my Mentor and working with Bootstrap I was able to implement a grid system that improved my design for mobiles and small devices.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
